# 2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions

> Narrow down the lowest index

> From successful pairs

> But we should't keep adding the same potions to the count

1. Sort the potions
2. Binary search while doing the production
3. Reture the len(potions) - left

> Why return the len(potions) - left?

**Loop Termination:** The loop continues until left exceeds right.
By the end of the loop, if there exists a potion that can form a successful pair, left will be pointing to the first such potion. This is because each time we found a potion at mid that could form a successful pair, we moved right to search further to its left.
If no such potion exists, left will be pointing to a potion greater than any existing potion, and thus, the result len(potions) - left will be 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def successfulPairs(self, spells: List[int], potions: List[int], success: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        potions.sort() # no reassign

        for s in spells:
            left = 0
            right = len(potions)-1
            count = 0
            while left <= right:
                mid = left+(right-left)//2 # Attention
                if s*potions[mid] < success:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
            res.append(len(potions) - left)
        return res
```

### Follow up question

Time complexity is O(nlogn)
1. Soting the potions list has a time complexity of O(mlogm), where m is the length of the potion list.
2. For each spells, we perform a binary search on the potions list. Since Binary search has a time complexity of O(logm). The complexity for this step is O(nlogn)
3. Combining the two steps, the overall time complexity is O(mlogm + nlogn) = O(nlogn)

Space complexity is O(n)
potions listO(n), res[] = O(n)
